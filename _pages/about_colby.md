Colby received his Bachelor's degree in Sociology from Wesleyan University in Middletown, CT, where he won the Herbert H.

During this time he also studied mathematics at Harvard University and presented a research paper on a graph-dynamical theory of transportation networks and social change at the International Conference on Complex Systems.  His interest in transportation engineering and planning would lead him to the University of California at Davis, where within a year he received a Masters' Degree in Transportation Technology and Policy.  He continues to publish and present independent research at national conferences, including work on transportation data modeling using large language models, building on online self-study and non-credit coursework at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.
