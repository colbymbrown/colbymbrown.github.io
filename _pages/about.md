>**syntaxâ€¢is** _(noun)_: a convergence of mountain ranges, or geological folds, towards a single point

EcoSyntax is a company at the nexus of code, economics, and ecology.  Our mission is to deliver software programs, products and projects founded on strong principles.

_**Eco**nomy_: Our flagship product, LuminCity, allows its users to understand markets and predict how they will perform under alternative scenarios.

_**Eco**logy_: Our open-source projects, such as **OLAF** and **LUC-LM**, provide flexible, highly detailed frameworks for understanding how human activity interacts with and affects the natural environment.

>**syntax** *noun* : a connected or orderly system : harmonious arrangement of parts or elements

We love to build systems of modular, minimalistic,  and  manageable tools.  These systems are usually more economical and less resource-hungry than sprawling "models of everything."

This is echoed in our response to the many opportunities provided by recent advances in generative AI.  Our people-centered AI agents are built using systems of smaller language models, fine-tuned to support specific tasks.  We are inspired by organizations like BigCode and the  initial effort that created the StarCoder model, trained exclusively on permissively licensed code.  We use it for interactive coding, for development of people-centered AI agents, and most importantly, for sequence modeling applications in the predictive models we build to support environmental analysis of land use and transportation plans.
