_**Eco**Syntax_ is a company at the nexus of code, economics, and ecology.  We deliver and support software products and open-source projects that help our users understand how markets and the natural environment interact.

We love systems of specialized, modular, configurable tools.  Such systems are usually more economical and less resource-hungry than monolithic software that attempts to over-generalize and do everything for everyone.

**syntax** *noun* : a connected or orderly system : harmonious arrangement of parts or elements
