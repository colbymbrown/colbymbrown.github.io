_**Eco**Syntax_ is a company at the nexus of code, economics, and ecology.  We deliver and support software products and open-source projects that help our users understand how markets and the natural environment interact.

>**syntaxâ€¢is** _(noun)_: a convergence of mountain ranges, or geological folds, towards a single point

We love systems of modular, minimalistic, manageable tools.  Such systems are usually more economical and less resource-hungry than sprawling "models of everything."

>**syntax** *noun* : a connected or orderly system : harmonious arrangement of parts or elements
